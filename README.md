# Simple-RSA-Encryption-using-Python


This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple **RSA cryptosystem** developed as part of a Cyber Security course assignment. The program demonstrates the fundamental steps of RSA encryption and decryption, including:

* Selection of prime numbers $p$ and $q$
* Computation of modulus $n = p \times q$ and Eulerâ€™s totient $\varphi(n)$
* Generation of the public key $(e, n)$ and private key $(d, n)$
* Encryption of plaintext messages (converted to ASCII values)
* Decryption of ciphertext back to the original message

This project is intended for **educational purposes only** to illustrate how RSA works on a small scale. The chosen primes are small and not suitable for real-world cryptographic security.
